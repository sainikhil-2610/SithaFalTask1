Chat with PDF Using RAG Pipeline

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to interact with data in multiple PDF files. It extracts, chunks, embeds, and stores data for efficient retrieval using FAISS, enabling users to query the PDFs and perform accurate comparisons using an LLM (Large Language Model).

Features:

Extract text and data from semi-structured PDF files.

Chunk and embed the data for similarity-based retrieval.

Efficiently handle user queries with natural language processing.

Perform comparative analyses across multiple PDF files.

Generate structured, factual responses using RAG.

Technologies Used:

Python: Programming language.

PyMuPDF: For PDF text extraction.

FAISS: For vector similarity search.

OpenAI / Hugging Face Models: For LLM responses.

Flask: For API development (optional for deployment).
